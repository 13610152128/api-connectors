# BitMEX Auto-Generated REST API clients
These clients partially implement [BitMEX's REST API.](https://testnet.bitmex.com/app/apiOverview)
They are auto-generated by [Swagger-Codegen.](https://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/)
These connectors are likely to be incomplete - BitMEX uses [a custom authentication scheme](https://testnet.bitmex.com/app/apiKeysUsage)
which is not recognized out of the box by swagger.

They are a starting point for integrating BitMEX's API with another application.
For complete connectors, see the [official-http](official-http/) directory.
